# Image Gallery App

Welcome to the Image Gallery App, a versatile Android application that allows users to explore and manage their favorite images. This README will provide you with an overview of the app, its features, and the technologies used to build it.

## Description

The Image Gallery App is designed to provide users with a seamless and enjoyable experience for browsing and saving their favorite images. Here are some key features:

- **Image Gallery**: Users can browse a wide collection of images displayed in a beautiful and user-friendly gallery layout.

- **Favorites**: The app enables users to mark images as favorites, making it easy to access and view their preferred pictures at any time.

- **Offline Access**: Even when the user is offline, they can still view their favorite images. The app uses local storage to cache images, ensuring a smooth offline experience.

## Technologies Used

The Image Gallery App is built using various technologies and libraries to enhance its functionality and maintainability. Here are some of the key technologies and libraries used:

- **Room Database**: We use Room Database to efficiently manage local storage, store image metadata, and enable offline access. It ensures data consistency and provides a seamless experience for users.

- **Retrofit**: Retrofit is utilized for making network requests and fetching images from remote servers. It helps in retrieving the latest images to keep the gallery up-to-date.

- **Dependency Injection (Hilt)**: Hilt is used for dependency injection, making the codebase more modular and maintainable. It simplifies the management of object creation and scope, enhancing overall code quality.

-  **MVVM Architecture**: The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern, separating the UI logic from the data handling and business logic. This ensures maintainability and testability of the codebase.
